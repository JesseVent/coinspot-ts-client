# CoinSpot API Documentation

This directory contains documentation and sample data for the CoinSpot API TypeScript client.

## Contents

- `api-samples/` - Sample API responses from live testing used as examples for the OpenAPI specification (hidden from git as they contain private API responses)

- Other documentation files and guides

## API Samples

The `api-samples` directory contains real API response examples from the CoinSpot API. These are used as sample payloads for the OpenAPI specification and can be useful for understanding response formats. Note: This directory is excluded from git as it contains private API responses.
